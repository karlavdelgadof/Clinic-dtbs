# Clinic Database 🏩 🧑🏻‍⚕️👩🏽‍⚕️🌡️

> This repo stores the schema of a clinic database that holds information about patients, treatments, medical history, invoices, etc. The primary purpose is to generate the database by following a provided diagram, interpret it, and implement the SQL needed to build that database.


# Database Schema diagram 📝

## Getting Started ➡️

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema_based_on_diagram.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly❗**
